    <h2 id="why-gratitude">Why Gratitude?</h2>
    <p>
        This is a tool meant to help you cultivate a sense of gratitude, and to remind
        you of the things in your life which draw you towards it. It only puts out
        what you put into it — think of it as a storehouse for your own experiences of
        gratitude.
    </p>
    <p>
        While my motivation for building this comes from my spiritual practices, there
        is nothing specifically religious about it, so if you are not inclined in that
        direction, you may still find something of value here.
    </p>
    <p>
        When I was a <a href="https://beajesuit.org/jesuit-formation/the-novitiate/" target="_blank">
        Jesuit novice</a>, my spiritual director was fond of reminding us to
        “go to gratitude” when faced with some challenge or spiritual bump in the
        road. It’s part of <a href="https://www.ignatianspirituality.com/ignatian-prayer/the-examen/" target="_blank">
        the twice-daily prayer practice of Jesuits</a> to review our
        thoughts, words, and actions in a methodical fashion, starting with gratitude
        for all our experiences. The reflection on gratitude is a crucial step,
        possibly the key to the entire experience of Ignatian spirituality.
    </p>

    <h2 id="how-to-use-it">How to use it</h2>
    <p>
        When you find something or think of something in your life that inspires
        gratitude, take a moment to reflect on it. Tap on the wood pile to inscribe
        into the rememberance fire, and make sure to place your context of gratitude into
        your own biological memory. It can be specific or general, informative or cryptic.
        Whatever works for you. You don’t have to explain or justify your gratitude to anyone.
    </p>
    <p>
        Examples:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>The morning light hitting Bell Rock in Sedona</li>
        <li>Strawberry Danishes</li>
        <li>The way my cat looks embarrassed when she misses a jump</li>
        <li>My friend Sarah</li>
        <li>January 26, 2005</li>
        <li>The time my brother told me how much he respected me</li>
        <li>Road trips</li>
        <li>The sea</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        Later, you can tap on the fire when you need to be reminded of gratitude.
        It will bring back one of the things you’ve stored away, to remind you of
        something good from your life. Once you’ve seen it, you can choose to retain
        it (if you’d like to see it again) or release it (if you feel it has served
        its purpose).
    </p>

    <h2 id="privacy">Privacy</h2>
    <p>
        Nothing ever leaves your browser. There’s no login necessary because nothing
        is stored on any servers. I don’t need (nor want) to see what you are grateful
        for; that’s between you and the fire.
    </p>
    <p>
        The downside of that, though, is that I store the items locally on your
        browser. That means that if you clear the cache (or don’t visit the site for a
        while), it may lose your data. That might make you sad, and that’s the last
        thing I want!
    </p>
    <p>
        The way to avoid that is to add this page to the home screen of your phone. On
        iOS, tap the “Share” button and select “Add to Home Screen.” On Android, tap
        the menu icon (the three dots at the top right) and choose “Add to Home
        screen.”
