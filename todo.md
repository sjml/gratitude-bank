1. Visual pass
    - smarter text packing into textures
    - summon FX
        - have smoke come up and it rises out, or something else that looks decent
        - continue rise (release)
        - fall back in (retain)
    - fire FX
        - moving light
        - sparks coming off
        - little moving globules
    - environment
        - lighting, sky, colors
        - trees and shrubs, little tufts of grass
        - rocks around fire
    - social share card, icon
        - refine UI animation timings (not a social thing, just a last step before sharing)
        - offline manifest
        - de-privatize repo
2. Stretches
    - ability to put log back instead of inscribing
    - prompts on wood pile and fire at start
    - fire FX
        - have fire briefly surge when log goes in
