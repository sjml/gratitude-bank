1. 3d pass
    - one more stab at trees
2. app/2d pass
    - make buttons fake so iOS doesn't flip out and we can pad them
    - tap animation bad in safari; doesn't update position on resize
    - refine UI animation timings
    - fire dies down when gratitude count is 0
        - affect fireLight intensity (animated), maybe the range of the movement, and the particles' emitRate, maxLifetime, and updateSpeed
    - have fire briefly surge when log goes in
3. share prep
    - social share card, icons
    - offline manifest
    - de-privatize repo

## Future
- would be nice to put some glow or something on the summoned gratitude
    - shaders're fun
- environment could be improved
    - tufts of grass
    - shrubs
    - critters
