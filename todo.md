1. app/2d pass
    - fire control:
        - affect fireLight intensity (animated), maybe the range of the movement, and the particles' emitRate, maxLifetime, and updateSpeed
        - fire dies down when gratitude count is 0
        - have fire briefly surge when log goes in
2. share prep
    - social share card, icons
    - should service-worker cache "/" or "./"? 
    - offline manifest
    - de-privatize repo

## Future
- would be nice to put some glow or something on the summoned gratitude
    - shaders're fun
- environment could be improved
    - roots on the trees
    - tufts of grass
    - shrubs
    - critters
