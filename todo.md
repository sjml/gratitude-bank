        - text, entered date, last seen, times seen
* Withdraw procedure
    - select item from local storage
    - render to canvas, make to texture
    - rise out fire with nice effects, stay hovering in front
    - swipe or tap down to retain, swipe or tap up to release
        - if retain: mark last seen
        - if release: remove from storage

    - overall lighting, sky, colors
    - trees and shrubs
    - rocks around fire
    - moving light
    - sparks coming off fire
