1. Visual pass
    - smarter text packing into textures
    - summon FX
        - basic effects in; give them some pizzazz
    - environment
        - lighting, sky, colors
        - trees and shrubs, little tufts of grasss
        - rocks around fire
    - last refinements
        - fire dies down when gratitude count is 0
        - refine UI animation timings
    - share prep
        - social share card, icons
        - offline manifest
        - de-privatize repo
2. Stretches
    - ability to put log back instead of inscribing
    - prompts on wood pile and fire at start
    - fire FX
        - have fire briefly surge when log goes in
