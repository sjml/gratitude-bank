1. summon FX
    - add more swoop to the summon
    - release anim needed
    - reposition camera for more headroom above the fire
2. last refinements
    - make buttons fake so iOS doesn't flip out and we can pad them
    - refine UI animation timings
    - fire dies down when gratitude count is 0
    - have fire briefly surge when log goes in
    - tap animation bad in safari; doesn't update position on resize
3. share prep
    - social share card, icons
    - offline manifest
    - de-privatize repo

Future
    - would be nice to put some glow or something on the summoned gratitude
        - shaders're fun
